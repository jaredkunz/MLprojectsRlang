## Overview
 

- The **input**  
- In the **training stage**,
- 
- In the **prediction stage**, 
## Dependencies
**RStudio (Latest Version) or Similar R IDE**, modern version of **R Project for Statistical Computing**, https://www.r-project.org/  Most of these are okay to install via your IDE.

## Getting started

1. **Get the code.** `$ git clone` the repo and install dependencies
2. **Get the data.** I don't distribute the data in the Git repo, instead download the data into the appropriate data folder.
3. **Train the model.**  
4. **Monitor the training.**  
5. **Evaluate model checkpoints.**  .
6. **Visualize the predictions.**
