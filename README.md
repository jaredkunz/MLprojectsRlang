# MLprojectsRlang
## Overview
This is a list of Machine Learning projects written in R Language. Many of these projects are tutorials, exercises and personal projects I've worked on as part of graduate courses I've taken. While the exercises may be perscribed from different coureses, the code written is my own code. If you see similarities in these exercises with any courses you are taking, please do not copy my code and re-use my code in your classes. Please just use my code as an example of one approach. I plan to expand on these tutorials and go deeper into them, i.e. improve them over time as my knowledge increases and based upon any feedback I receive. 

I plan to give each project a simple ID number between 000 to 999 (I doubt I will create more 1000 projects, tutorials and exercises out here in my lifetime, yet it's possible). Any questions feel free to reach out to me here or on https://wwww.jaredkunz.com or my linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredkunz/). Thank you,

[**Project #001: How to Find a Good Classifier using Support Vector Machines**](https://github.com/jaredkunz/MLprojectsRlang/tree/main/001proj-svmclassifiers)

The rest of this readme file is in work, but this is the basic structure it will take eventually.

- The **input**  
- In the **training stage**,
- - In the **prediction stage**, 
## Dependencies
**RStudio (Latest Version) or Similar R IDE**, modern version of **R Project for Statistical Computing**, https://www.r-project.org/  Most of these are okay to install via your IDE.

## Getting started

1. **Get the code.** `$ git clone` the repo and install dependencies
2. **Get the data.** I don't distribute the data in the Git repo, instead download the data into the appropriate data folder.
3. **Train the model.**  
4. **Monitor the training.**  
5. **Evaluate model checkpoints.**  .
6. **Visualize the predictions.**  

## Using the models to predict on new data
